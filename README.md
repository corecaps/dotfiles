# dotfiles

This repository is mainly for my personnal usage, please note that i did not create those config from scratch and has taken inspiration from many sources so donÂ´t give me credit for anything and take what you need ^^

My dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) if you want to learn more about using stow to versin control and backup your dotfiles there is a great tutoriel [here](https://learn.typecraft.dev/tutorial/never-lose-your-configs-again/)
